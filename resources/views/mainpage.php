    <h4>Our Methods</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>"If we can't measure, we can't manage."</strong> <br/>
      These are the simple yet a globally accepted business thrust in any strategy focused corporation. We do not consider our consultancy assignment to have been successfully completed unless it contributes quantifiably to improving our client's income. Here at ESC we "walk the talk" by collectively formulate strategic concepts with our clients to develop the measures that are necessary to operationally achieve the desired changes.
