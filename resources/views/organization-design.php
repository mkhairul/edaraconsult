    <h4>Organization Design</h4>
    <p>Given the range of activities, from cost to profit drivers, to be undertaken in a business company, the issue arises as to how activities and people performing these activities be grouped together in the manner which produce the most effective overall organizational performance.</p>
    <p>Companies&rsquo; structures needs to organic, dynamic, fit, and align with business strategy and work culture in order to achieve the desired overall performance and value.</p>
    <p>We approach the development of our client&rsquo;s company structure design taking into account the above considerations and collaboratively work closely with our clients to understand current situation and identify primary cost-drivers before embarking into the robust process of designing the structure.</p>
