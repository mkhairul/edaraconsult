        <p><strong>Business acumen and finance for non-finance:</strong>&nbsp; This is a 3 days programme going through a board game. The board game is a motor vehicle manufacturing and marketing company.&nbsp; The participants are divided into group of 3.&nbsp; They will then be divided into roles of Finance, Sales and Production.</p>
        <p>This is a highly interactive game where all companies will bid for projects.  It is played by quarters and into 4 to 5 years time frame.  The participating companies must outbid each other.  They also can sub out contracts or buy or exchange stocks among themselves.  This will enhance their negotiation skills.</p>

        <p><strong>Changing Mindset:</strong>&nbsp; To thrive in a rapidly changing business world, companies must anticipate change and innovate.&nbsp; For that they need to cultivate a mindset that reflects the reality of the future - which will be marked by (a) increasing global integration, (b) increasingly multi-polar world economy and (c) heterogeneity across cultures and markets will remain an enduring feature of the global economy for many decades to come.</p>
        <p>These issues make changing of mindset skills more important than ever. This workshop builds skills for framing, analyzing, and resolving the complex problems you face every day in your corporate role.</p>

        <p><strong>Strategic Thinking:</strong> In today&rsquo;s highly competitive world, strategy cannot be developed in isolation by a planning team.&nbsp; It must be a continual process that is part of the work culture and processes of the entire organization. This workshop helps people at upper and middle managers improve their ability to meet big and small strategic challenges.</p>

        <p><strong>Practical Strategic Planning:</strong> There is much written every year on strategy and planning. However, there is little guidance available on the nuts and bolts of how to actually organize a better strategy process in your company. This workshop outlines a simple but powerful process to create a strategic system for continuous learning and sustainable profitable growth.</p>
