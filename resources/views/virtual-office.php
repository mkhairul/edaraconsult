    <h4>Virtual Administrative Office Services</h4>
    <p>As the role of the Internet and its effect on the business community evolves, what once had to be done in a traditional corporate office can now be done in one's home, in satellite offices, or while traveling.<br />
    <br />
    We provide office administration services to business companies from start-up to 150 employees sized businesses needing temporary or project-based assistance.<br />
    <br />
    The members of Administrative Office Services are highly skilled, independent professionals, working outside of traditional corporate roles utilizing the Internet and other emerging technologies to customize our own work environments.<br />
    <br />
    We recognize that many start-up and small businesses are either unable or unwilling to pay the full-time costs associated with traditional administrative support.&nbsp; And we recognize that time is valuable and offer the assistance needed to boost our client's own productivity by handling many of the more routine administrative tasks of the business.<br />
